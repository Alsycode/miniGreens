# MiniGreens Mobile — Pre-Release QA Sweep & Bug Fix Plan

> **Purpose:** a complete, nothing-skipped test pass over `src/` (the Expo mobile app) before it
> ships — every screen, every admin↔mobile data connection, functional bugs and UI polish. This
> file is **append-only for the Session Log and Bug Log** and **live-edited for the Status Board**,
> same convention as `TASK_PLAN.md`. It exists so the sweep can span many sessions without losing
> state or silently skipping an area.

---

## 🔁 HOW TO RESUME (read this first, every session)

1. **Read this entire file top to bottom.** Trust it over assumptions about what's already tested.
2. Check the **Status Board**. Find the first area that is `TODO` or `IN PROGRESS`.
3. Work that area's checklist top to bottom (functional checks, then UI checks). For each admin↔
   mobile connection point, actually perform the write on one side and verify the read on the other
   — don't just read code and assume it works.
4. **Every bug found goes in the Bug Log immediately**, even small ones — a cosmetic misalignment
   gets a row just like a broken mutation. Don't fix silently without logging first.
5. **Fix bugs as you find them** (this is a fix-as-you-go sweep, not log-then-batch) unless a bug
   needs a decision only the user can make (see "Needs a decision" rows) — then leave it open and
   flag it in your end-of-turn summary.
6. **Before context runs out:** flip the area's Status Board row, update the Bug Log (status column:
   `open` / `fixed` / `wontfix` / `needs-decision`), and append a dated Session Log entry describing
   what was tested, what broke, what got fixed, and what's still open.
7. An area is not `DONE` until: its functional checklist is verified live (not just typechecked),
   `npx tsc --noEmit` is clean for `src/`, and every bug logged against it is `fixed` or explicitly
   deferred with the user's sign-off.
8. Never delete Bug Log or Session Log rows — status changes, rows don't disappear.

### Known tooling limit — read before claiming device parity

This environment can only run and verify the app through the **Expo web preview** (`expo start
--web`), driven by the in-app browser tools. There is no iOS/Android simulator or physical device
here. That means:
- Anything that behaves differently on native (haptics, native document/image pickers, push
  notification delivery, deep-link handling from a killed state, native gesture nuances, the
  Reanimated-web `visibility:hidden` quirk already documented in `TASK_PLAN.md`) can be **code-
  reviewed and web-verified** but not device-verified from here.
- Before actually publishing, the user (or a session with device/simulator access) must do a real
  device pass on both iOS and Android — this plan's Q14/Q15 areas call that out explicitly as a
  human checkpoint, not something to mark DONE from web-only verification.

## ✅ STATUS BOARD

| ID | Area | Status |
|----|------|--------|
| Q1 | Auth & onboarding | IN PROGRESS — gating + validation fixes done & live-verified; OTP success path blocked on a test inbox (see Q1 notes) |
| Q2 | Home | TODO |
| Q3 | Catalogue (Explore / Search / Category / Product detail) | IN PROGRESS — read-only checks + availability fixes done; admin-write checks need a go-ahead (see Q3 notes) |
| Q4 | Cart, Checkout & Pre-order | IN PROGRESS — stock blocker resolved (DB ledger works); code review done; live order placement blocked on a test account; decisions on bugs 23 & 24 needed |
| Q5 | Orders (list, detail, status sync) | IN PROGRESS — regression found & fixed (code-reviewed only); live status-sync check needs a test account |
| Q6 | Subscriptions (curated, custom, manage) | IN PROGRESS — error-swallowing + signed-out gaps fixed & live-verified; admin engine round-trip needs a go-ahead |
| Q7 | Partner / B2B | TODO |
| Q8 | Offers & Discounts | TODO |
| Q9 | Notifications | TODO |
| Q10 | Profile & Account | TODO |
| Q11 | Content (Healthy Living articles, Women Who Grow, legal/support) | TODO |
| Q12 | Cross-cutting UI/UX pass (all screens) | TODO |
| Q13 | Data integrity & security spot-check | TODO |
| Q14 | Performance & stability | TODO |
| Q15 | Deployment readiness checklist | TODO |

Recommended order: **Q1 → Q3 → Q4 → Q5 → Q2 → Q6 → Q7 → Q8 → Q9 → Q10 → Q11 → Q12 → Q13 → Q14 → Q15**
(auth and catalogue first since almost everything downstream needs a logged-in session and real
products; Home last among the functional areas since it touches nearly every other table and is
easiest to verify once the rest is proven).

## 🐛 BUG LOG

Append a row per bug the moment it's found. Never delete a row — update `status` in place.

| # | Area | Severity | Summary | Status |
|---|------|----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Q1 | major | `subscription/manage` shows "No subscription yet / Browse Plans" to a signed-out visitor instead of a sign-in prompt | fixed |
| 2 | Q1 | major | `profile/addresses` opens signed-out with a permanent spinner-less empty list and an active "Add New Address" button | fixed |
| 3 | Q1 | major | `profile/edit` renders a fully editable form signed-out; Save silently no-ops | fixed |
| 4 | Q1 | major | `notifications` shows "You're all caught up" to a signed-out visitor | fixed |
| 5 | Q1 | major | `checkout` reachable signed-out with an empty cart (shows ₹40 total, "Continue to Delivery"); Place Order silently returns if profile not loaded | fixed |
| 6 | Q1 | major | `partner/dashboard` stays on a spinner forever when signed out (`load()` returns before clearing `loading`) | fixed |
| 7 | Q1 | minor | Login shows raw Supabase text "Unable to validate email address: invalid format" for a malformed email | fixed (client-side format check, friendly copy) |
| 8 | Q1 | minor | Stale comment in `useAuthStore.sendCode` said "6-digit code"; UI and webapp use 8 | fixed |
| 9 | Q1 | needs-decision | Onboarding slide 1 copy says "Premium cold-pressed juices … made every morning" — brand is microgreens-first and the webapp promises "cut to order, never stored" | needs-decision (content owner) |
| 10 | Q1 | needs-decision | Onboarding hero image is a strawberry smoothie on a microgreens brand | needs-decision (content owner) |
| 11 | Q1 | needs-decision | No resend-code button on the code step (plan expected a 30s resend cooldown); only "Use a different email" | needs-decision — add resend, or accept current workaround |
| 12 | Q1 | minor | Non-email error messages (e.g. rate limiting) from Supabase are shown raw | open — low priority |
| 13 | Q1 | unverified | Onboarding Next/swipe doesn't advance in the web preview (Skip works). Likely web-only FlatList behaviour | open — verify on a real device |
| 14 | Q6 | major | `subscription/manage` pause / resume / cancel ignore Supabase `error` results — UI reports success even when the write fails | open — fix in Q6 |
| 15 | Q10 | minor | `profile/edit` initial fields are set from the profile at mount; if the profile loads after mount the form stays blank | open |
| 16 | Q3 | major | Product detail for a switched-off product (`is_available=false`, e.g. Choco Chill) still showed an active **Pre-order** button, which routes into an order flow | fixed — button disabled "Currently Unavailable", pre-order note hidden, `preorder/[slug]` refuses unavailable products |
| 17 | Q3 | major | `addItemBySlug` never checked `is_available` or stock, so an unavailable (or zero-stock, non-pre-order) product could be added to the cart | fixed — refuses both; stock check skipped for pre-order items |
| 18 | Q3 | minor | Add-to-cart failures gave only a haptic buzz, no message | partly fixed — detail button now shows the reason; the card steppers on Explore/Home/Search are still silent — open, low priority |
| 19 | Q3 | needs-decision | A pre-order product that's switched off disappears from Explore/Search/Home entirely (the T4 caveat). Choco Chill is live proof. Hidden is the current behaviour | needs-decision — keep hidden, or show as "Currently unavailable" |
| 20 | Q3 | needs-decision | **All 26 live products have `is_preorder = true`**, so the normal Add-to-Cart branch is effectively unused in production. Is the catalogue pre-order-only by design? This shapes Q4 | needs-decision |
| 21 | Q4 | needs-decision | Cart quantity increments don't cap at stock. The DB deliberately allows overselling and flags it (`20260930120000_order_stock_ledger.sql`: `oversold = true`), so this may be intended | needs-decision — allow oversell (current DB design) or cap in cart |
| 23 | Q4 | blocker (decision) | **Delivery fee contradicts the promise.** Mobile checkout always charges ₹40, webapp ₹35.49, but Home ("Free delivery ₹499+"), the FAQ, and the Shipping Policy page (ported in T16) all promise free delivery over ₹499 (the policy also says ₹35). The webapp's HOMEPAGE_PLAN already lists this as an open issue | needs-decision — implement the ₹499 threshold, or change the copy. Pricing is the owner's call |
| 24 | Q4 | major (security) | **Order totals and item prices are computed on the client and trusted by the server.** `orders.total`, `discount_amount`, and `order_items.price` are written straight from the app, so a modified client could place an order at any price or with a fabricated discount. Pre-order carries no payment today, so impact is order-integrity and discount abuse, not card fraud | open — fix needs a DB change (price/total computed server-side from `products` and `validate_discount`). Needs your go-ahead |
| 25 | Q4 | minor | Cart screen shows Subtotal only, with no delivery fee or total, unlike checkout and the webapp cart | open — low priority |
| 26 | Q4 | info | Stock ledger is working. Triggers reserve stock on order insert and item insert, and release it on cancel or delete. This closes the Q4 blocker suspicion from the plan | closed |
| 27 | Q5 | major | **Regression:** the Orders list and order detail screens no longer show the PRE-ORDER pill or "Expected availability" date that `TASK_PLAN.md` T4 recorded as built — both were dropped during the UI-refinement rewrite of `(tabs)/orders.tsx` and `order/[id].tsx` (confirmed via these files' current content vs. T4's "What was built" notes) | fixed — restored both, using the same `expected_availability_date`/`order_type` columns that were always there |
| 28 | Q5 | needs-decision | Every order shows a "Payment: Pending" badge with no action, since there's no payment collection step anymore (Razorpay removed). The label may now be meaningless noise rather than useful status | needs-decision — drop the row, relabel it, or leave as-is |
| 29 | Q5 | info | `order/[id].tsx` fetches by `id` alone with no `profile_id` filter in the query — relies entirely on RLS (`orders_select_own_or_admin`) to block cross-user reads. Confirmed that policy exists and is correctly scoped (`profile_id = auth.uid() or is_admin()`) | verified safe, not a bug |
| 30 | Q5 | minor | Orders-list fetch failure (network error) is indistinguishable from a genuinely empty list — both show "No Orders Yet" | open — low priority |
| 31 | Q6 | major | `subscription/manage.tsx` pause/resume/cancel ignored Supabase `error` results — UI reported success even when the write failed (carried over from the Q1 note, bug 14) | fixed — each now checks `error` and shows an `ErrorNotice` with specific copy |
| 32 | Q6 | major | `subscription/plan.tsx` and `subscription/custom.tsx` are reachable signed-out via direct navigation (same class as the Q1 screens); Start Subscription silently no-ops | fixed — same `Screen`+`EmptyState` login-prompt pattern, live-verified |
| 33 | Q6 | needs-decision | `custom.tsx`'s quantity stepper has no stock cap, same as the cart (bug 21) — consistent with the DB's oversell-and-flag design, not a new issue | tracked under bug 21's decision |
| 34 | Q6 | minor | `(tabs)/subscriptions.tsx`'s plan fetch has no error handling — a network failure renders the same as "no plans available" would | open — low priority, same class as bug 30 |
| 35 | Q6 | minor | First-delivery-date fields on both subscription screens are free-text (no date picker, no format validation before insert) — an invalid string surfaces as Supabase's raw Postgres error | open — low priority |
| 36 | Q6 | info | Admin's "generate orders now" engine (curated + custom, idempotency) was verified end-to-end in a prior session (2026-09-21, see `GAP_REPORT.md`). Not re-run here — would create/delete real test data, needs a go-ahead | not re-verified this session |
| 22 | Q3 | info | T15 (PDP rating display) was already implemented — the PDP shows stars + "4.9 (81 reviews)". The earlier audit note was wrong | closed — see TASK_PLAN T15 |

Severity guide: **blocker** (crashes, data loss, can't complete a core flow) · **major** (feature
broken or gives wrong data, no crash) · **minor** (cosmetic, edge case, non-blocking) ·
**needs-decision** (not a bug per se — a product choice only the user can make, e.g. "should
Settings toggles actually persist, or is the current no-op acceptable for v1").

---

## 🗺️ KNOWN CARRY-IN ITEMS (from prior sessions — verify, don't re-discover)

These are flagged already in `TASK_PLAN.md` / prior memory and should be explicitly checked as
part of the relevant area below, not treated as new findings if confirmed still true:

- **T15 (open):** mobile PDP (`product/[id].tsx`) has no rating/review aggregate display, even
  though `products.rating`/`review_count` are populated. Check during Q3.
- **Stock decrement may be dead code.** Per `project_order_flow_audit` memory, inventory decrement
  was inlined into `verify_razorpay_payment()` — but the Razorpay payment flow was later removed
  entirely from mobile checkout (`checkout/index.tsx` now inserts straight into `orders` with no
  payment step). If nothing else calls that function, **stock may never decrement anymore on any
  order placed from mobile or webapp.** This is a strong blocker candidate — verify first thing in
  Q4 by placing a real preorder and checking `products.stock` before/after.
- **`profile/settings.tsx` toggles are non-functional** (local `useState` only, never persisted) —
  already known, not a new bug, but Q10 must decide: fix for real, or explicitly accept as a v1
  limitation (needs-decision, not an auto-fix).
- **`partner/business-order.tsx` is feature-flagged off** (`BUSINESS_ORDER_ENABLED = false`) on
  both mobile and webapp — confirmed intentional, not a bug. Q7 should just confirm it still fails
  gracefully (no crash) if reached, not try to re-enable it.
- **`src/mock/index.ts` has several dead exports** (`orders`, `addresses`, `profile`, `faqs`,
  `searchSuggestions`, `subscriptionPlans`) per the earlier mobile inventory — candidate for
  cleanup in Q12, confirm nothing silently still reads them before deleting.
- **Partner payouts UI was removed from `partner/dashboard.tsx`** (2026-10-06, see `TASK_PLAN.md`
  T6) — Q7 should confirm the dashboard still renders cleanly post-removal (no leftover styles/
  imports causing a lint-only issue) rather than re-litigating the removal itself.

## 📋 AREAS (detailed)

### Q1 — Auth & onboarding

**Screens:** `index.tsx` (splash/router), `onboarding.tsx`, `auth/login.tsx`.
**DB:** `profiles` (via `handle_new_user()` trigger on `auth.users` insert). **Admin connection:**
none directly, but every other admin screen that reads `profiles` (Customers, Partners, Orders)
depends on this trigger firing correctly.

**Functional:**
- [ ] Fresh state (no onboarding flag, no session) → onboarding carousel → login, never skips straight to tabs.
- [ ] Onboarding "skip"/finish persists the flag (MMKV) so it never reappears.
- [ ] Email OTP signup: new email → 8-digit code → full name/DOB completion step → lands in tabs → `profiles` row exists with the DOB set.
- [ ] Email OTP login: existing email → code → straight to tabs (no DOB step repeated).
- [ ] Wrong/expired code shows a clear error, doesn't crash, allows retry.
- [ ] Resend-code cooldown (30s) actually blocks a second send and counts down visibly.
- [ ] Session persists across app relaunch (MMKV-backed Supabase storage) — close and reopen, still logged in.
- [ ] Sign out (from Profile) clears session and returns to login; signing back in works.
- [ ] Any screen that's auth-gated (Orders, Offers, Subscriptions, Partner, Profile sub-pages) correctly redirects to login when signed out, and back to the original destination after login (if that's the intended behavior — confirm what actually happens, don't assume).

**UI:**
- [ ] Onboarding carousel swipe gestures smooth, dots/indicators correct, no flash of unstyled content.
- [ ] Login form: keyboard type correct for email field, keyboard avoids the input on both the email and code steps, loading state on submit, disabled state on empty/invalid input.
- [ ] Splash screen hides at the right time (no visible blank frame before the first real screen).

---

### Q2 — Home

**Screen:** `src/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`.
**DB:** `products`, `categories`, `discounts`, `notifications` (unread count), `profiles.date_of_birth`.
**Admin connection:** Products, Categories, Discounts screens.

**Functional:**
- [ ] Admin marks a product `is_best_seller` / `is_seasonal` / `is_featured` → appears in the matching Home rail after a refetch (react-query `staleTime` may delay — note actual delay observed).
- [ ] Admin creates a non-birthday active discount → OffersBanner shows it; admin deactivates it → banner disappears.
- [ ] Birthday banner only appears when `date_of_birth` month/day matches today AND an active `is_birthday_offer` discount exists; dismiss persists for the session (confirm intended behavior — does it come back on next app open? check what's actually coded, not assumed).
- [ ] DOB nudge banner (T13) only shows when signed in, profile loaded, and `date_of_birth` is null; tapping routes to `/profile/edit`; setting DOB there makes the banner disappear on return to Home.
- [ ] PartnerBanner shows the right state for each `partnerStatus` (none/pending/approved) and routes correctly.
- [ ] Find Your Blend (T13): confirm it degrades gracefully if an admin renames/deletes one of the 8 tea-blend slugs it depends on (`green-vitality-bag` etc.) — moment should drop out rather than crash or show a broken row.
- [ ] Signature Product (T13): same graceful-degrade check for `green-detox-bag` specifically — if that product is deleted/renamed, confirm the whole section just disappears, no crash.
- [ ] Business CTA chips (T13) each route to `/partner/apply?type=<value>` with that chip pre-selected (already verified once for `cafe` and `women` — spot-check the remaining 3: restaurant, shop, fitness_wellness).
- [ ] Notification bell badge count matches real unread `notifications` rows for the signed-in profile.
- [ ] Cart badge count matches the local cart store's item count.

**UI:**
- [ ] All T13 sections (Find Your Blend, Signature Product, Farm Story, Business CTA) match the visual language of the pre-existing sections (spacing, typography scale, corner radii) — spot anything that looks bolted-on.
- [ ] Horizontal scroll sections (category chips, Best Sellers, Seasonal, Find Your Blend) don't clip the last card awkwardly.
- [ ] Long product names / long discount codes don't overflow their containers.
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh (if present) or focus-refetch actually refreshes stale data.

---

### Q3 — Catalogue (Explore / Search / Category / Product detail)

**Screens:** `(tabs)/explore.tsx`, `search.tsx`, `category/[slug].tsx`, `product/[id].tsx`.
**DB:** `products`, `categories` via `src/services/catalog.ts`.
**Admin connection:** Products & Categories screens (full CRUD).

**Functional:**
- [ ] Create a brand-new product in admin → shows up in Explore and its category listing.
- [ ] Edit price/description/nutrition/benefits in admin → reflected on the product detail screen.
- [ ] Set `is_available = false` in admin → product disappears from Explore/Search/Category/Home, **except** confirm the known T4 caveat: a pre-order product that's also marked unavailable currently vanishes entirely (no `.or(is_available.eq.true,is_preorder.eq.true)` fallback was added per TASK_PLAN T4 notes) — reproduce this and log it (severity: decide major vs needs-decision; it may be intentional).
- [ ] Delete a product in admin that's sitting in someone's cart locally — confirm checkout fails gracefully (doesn't crash, shows a sensible error) rather than inserting a broken order_item.
- [ ] Create/rename/reorder a category in admin → chip order and category page both update.
- [ ] Search: query matches name/tag substring as expected; empty results show an empty state, not a blank screen.
- [ ] **T15 carry-in:** confirm product detail has no rating/review display (expected, still open) — don't fix here, just confirm current state for the T15 handoff.
- [ ] Add-to-cart stepper on every card variant (default/horizontal/compact/seasonal) correctly increments/decrements and matches the cart's actual quantity.
- [ ] Pre-order CTA appears only for `is_preorder` products and routes to `/preorder/[slug]`.

**UI:**
- [ ] Image loading: every product with a real Storage image URL vs. the `LOCAL_IMAGE_BY_SLUG` fallback both render without a broken-image flash.
- [ ] Category filter chips: active state is visually distinct; tapping twice doesn't get stuck.
- [ ] Loading skeletons appear during fetch, not a blank flash; error state (kill network mid-load) shows `ErrorNotice` with a working retry.
- [ ] Long category/product descriptions truncate consistently (`numberOfLines`) without layout jump.

---

### Q4 — Cart, Checkout & Pre-order

**Screens:** `cart.tsx`, `checkout/index.tsx`, `checkout/success.tsx`, `preorder/[slug].tsx`.
**DB:** `orders`, `order_items`, `addresses`, `discounts` (via `validate_discount` RPC), `products.stock`.
**Admin connection:** Orders screen (every order placed here must appear there correctly typed).

**Functional — do this first, it's the highest-risk item in the whole sweep:**
- [ ] **Stock decrement check.** Note a product's `stock` value in admin. Place a real preorder for
  it from mobile. Re-check `stock` in admin. If it did **not** decrease, this confirms the dead-
  code suspicion flagged above — log it as a **blocker** (inventory never depletes, admin has no
  real signal of what's actually sellable) and decide the fix with the user (likely: add the
  decrement directly into the `orders` insert path or a trigger on `order_items` insert, since
  there's no payment-verification step left to hang it off of).
- [ ] Add items from multiple screens (Explore, Search, Product detail, Home rails) → cart totals match.
- [ ] Apply a valid coupon at checkout → discount line appears, total recomputes correctly, order row stores `discount_code`/`discount_amount`.
- [ ] Apply an expired / usage-capped / birthday-outside-window coupon → correct rejection message for each case (don't just test one and assume the others work).
- [ ] Place an order with an existing saved address vs. adding a new one inline — both paths insert a correct `addresses` row and link it on the order.
- [ ] Rollback check (BUG-10 per code comments): if the `order_items` insert fails after the `orders` row is created, confirm the order row is actually deleted, not left as an orphaned empty order. (May need to force a failure — e.g. a product deleted mid-checkout — to actually exercise this rather than just reading the code.)
- [ ] Place a pre-order (`preorder/[slug].tsx`) — confirm `order_type='preorder'`, zero delivery fee, no payment step, and it appears in admin Orders under the Pre-orders filter with working ETA-set and convert-to-standard actions.
- [ ] Place a business order path — confirm it's unreachable (flag is off) without crashing if someone deep-links to it directly.
- [ ] New order appears in Admin Orders **immediately** (no filter hiding it) with the correct order_type, items, address, and total.
- [ ] Checkout success screen loads the just-placed order correctly; the documented 8s fallback-timeout path actually triggers something sensible if the load is slow/fails.

**UI:**
- [ ] Delivery fee display matches whatever the current real logic computes (confirm the ₹40 vs ₹35.49 discrepancy noted between mobile and webapp in old BUG notes — are they still different? should they match?).
- [ ] Empty cart state is a real empty state, not a blank screen.
- [ ] Coupon field: loading/applied/error visual states are all distinct and clear.
- [ ] Address picker: selected state obvious, "add new" flow doesn't lose the rest of the form's filled fields.

---

### Q5 — Orders (list, detail, status sync)

**Screens:** `(tabs)/orders.tsx`, `order/[id].tsx`.
**DB:** `orders`, `order_items`, `addresses`; notification trigger on status change.
**Admin connection:** Orders screen status-change actions.

**Functional:**
- [ ] Orders list excludes `order_type='business'` (per BUG-05 note) — confirm still true.
- [ ] Change an order's status in admin through each step (pending → confirmed → processing →
  shipped → delivered) → mobile order detail's status tracker updates on refetch/focus, and a
  notification row + (if token present) push fires each time.
- [ ] Cancel an order in admin (if that's a supported admin action) → mobile reflects `cancelled` sensibly (not stuck mid-tracker).
- [ ] Order detail correctly suppresses any payment-related CTA for pre-orders (confirmed in T4 notes — re-verify it's still true after other changes).
- [ ] Tapping an order-status notification deep-links to the correct `order/[id]`.

**UI:**
- [ ] Status tracker animation/steps render correctly for every status value, including `cancelled` if that's a real status (confirm it has a presentable state, not just a gap in the tracker).
- [ ] Orders list empty state (new account, zero orders) is a real empty state with a CTA to shop.
- [ ] Long address / notes text doesn't break the order detail layout.

---

### Q6 — Subscriptions (curated, custom, manage)

**Screens:** `(tabs)/subscriptions.tsx`, `subscription/plan.tsx`, `subscription/custom.tsx`, `subscription/manage.tsx`.
**DB:** `subscription_plans`, `subscriptions`, `subscription_items`.
**Admin connection:** Subscriptions screen (view, "generate orders now" action, active-revenue calc).

**Functional:**
- [ ] Subscribe to a curated plan, picking real products for each category slot → `subscriptions` + correct `subscription_items`/plan link rows.
- [ ] Build-your-own (`custom.tsx`): pick arbitrary products+quantities, weekly/monthly, consent
  checkboxes gate submit correctly → `is_custom=true` subscription with the right `subscription_items`.
- [ ] `manage.tsx` shows the right display for **both** a curated and a custom subscription (name/price computed correctly for custom, per the nullable-FK fix noted in GAP_REPORT item 2).
- [ ] Pause / resume / cancel each actually update `subscriptions.status` and the admin Subscriptions list reflects it.
- [ ] Admin "generate orders now" / the cron path produces one order with correct `order_items` for a test subscription of each kind (curated whole-box line vs. custom per-product lines), and does not double-fire on a second same-day call (idempotency, previously verified — re-confirm it's not since regressed).

**UI:**
- [ ] Frequency chip (weekly/monthly) selected state is clear; quantity steppers in `custom.tsx` can't go negative or past any product's real stock if that's meant to be enforced (confirm whether stock-capping is even implemented here — may be another gap).
- [ ] "My Subscription" entry point from Profile menu correctly reflects the current subscription, not a stale cached one, after a pause/cancel.

---

### Q7 — Partner / B2B

**Screens:** `partner/apply.tsx`, `partner/submitted.tsx`, `partner/dashboard.tsx`, `partner/business-order.tsx` (disabled).
**DB:** `partners` table, `partner-kyc` Storage bucket.
**Admin connection:** Partners screen (approve/reject, KYC verify, fee edit).

**Functional:**
- [ ] Apply with each business type, including via the new T13/T14 deep links (`?type=cafe`,
  `restaurant`, `shop`, `fitness_wellness`, `community`, `women`) — each correctly pre-selects its
  chip (spot-checked cafe/women already; check the remaining ones here).
- [ ] Upload a KYC document → lands in the `partner-kyc` bucket under the user's uid → visible and
  openable from the admin drawer via signed URL.
- [ ] Remove a KYC doc before submitting → actually removed from Storage, not just the local list.
- [ ] Submit application → lands on `partner/submitted.tsx` → a `partners` row exists with status `pending`.
- [ ] Admin approves → mobile `partner/dashboard.tsx` flips to the approved view (stats + order
  history, **no payout UI**, confirming the Q-carry-in item above), Profile menu item changes from
  "apply"/"under review" to "Partner Dashboard", and the partner badge appears next to the name.
- [ ] Admin rejects → mobile reflects the rejected state with a sensible message, and re-applying (if allowed) works or is correctly blocked (confirm the one-partner-row-per-profile constraint behavior).
- [ ] `partner/business-order.tsx` reached via any stale deep link shows the "temporarily unavailable" message without crashing.

**UI:**
- [ ] Business-type chip row wraps sensibly on a narrow screen with 7 options.
- [ ] KYC upload progress/spinner states are clear; the known `expo-document-picker` web-teardown
  `removeChild` redbox (documented, upload still succeeds) is **web-preview-only noise** — confirm
  it does not reproduce as a real issue in a native build (flag for the human device pass, don't
  try to "fix" a web-only artifact).

---

### Q8 — Offers & Discounts

**Screens:** `offers.tsx`, Home's OffersBanner/BirthdayBanner, checkout coupon field.
**DB:** `discounts` table, `validate_discount` RPC.
**Admin connection:** Discounts screen (full CRUD).

**Functional:**
- [ ] Admin creates each discount shape — flat, percentage, birthday-gated, with a `min_order_value`, with a `usage_limit`, with an `expires_at` in the past — and mobile's My Offers list / checkout apply each behave correctly per shape (6 separate checks, not one).
- [ ] A discount scoped via `target` (category/product/subscription_plan/partner/wholesale — per the GAP_REPORT item 4 note that these are currently unused enum labels with no real scoping) — confirm current behavior is indeed "ignored, applies globally regardless of target" so this isn't silently broken in a way nobody noticed. If still true, this is a **needs-decision** row (build real scoping, or remove the unused enum values), not a bug to silently fix.
- [ ] Tap-to-copy on an offer code actually copies (toast/haptic feedback present).

**UI:**
- [ ] My Offers empty state (no active discounts) is real, not blank.
- [ ] Expired/invalid coupon error copy at checkout is specific (not a generic "error") for each distinct rejection reason the RPC can return.

---

### Q9 — Notifications

**Screen:** `notifications.tsx`, Home bell badge.
**DB:** `notifications` table, triggers on order status / birthday / partner status.
**Admin connection:** indirect — admin's order-status and partner-approval actions are what fire these triggers.

**Functional:**
- [ ] Every trigger source produces a correctly-typed row: `order_status`, `birthday`, `partner`, and confirm whether `offer`/`system` types are ever actually produced anywhere or are dead enum values (per TASK_PLAN T3 notes, "coupon becomes available" was explicitly not wired — confirm still true, not a bug).
- [ ] Unread dot/badge count is accurate and updates promptly (confirm the actual staleTime/refetch behavior — is it realtime, focus-based, or does it lag noticeably?).
- [ ] Mark-one-read and mark-all-read both persist (`read_at` actually set in DB, not just local state).
- [ ] Tapping each notification **type** deep-links correctly — order status → that order, everything else → the inbox (per `routeFromNotificationData` — exercise every type, not just one).

**UI:**
- [ ] Unread vs read rows are visually distinct; list is newest-first.
- [ ] Empty inbox state is real.

---

### Q10 — Profile & Account

**Screens:** `(tabs)/profile.tsx`, `profile/edit.tsx`, `profile/addresses.tsx`, `profile/settings.tsx`,
`profile/about.tsx`, `profile/contact.tsx`, `profile/faq.tsx`, `profile/privacy.tsx`, `profile/terms.tsx`,
`profile/returns.tsx`, `profile/shipping-policy.tsx`.
**DB:** `profiles`, `addresses`, `orders`/`subscriptions` counts.
**Admin connection:** Customers screen reads the same `profiles`/`addresses`/`orders`/`subscriptions` data — cross-check a profile edited on mobile shows correctly there.

**Functional:**
- [ ] Edit name/phone/DOB → persists → **also reflects correctly in Admin's Customers screen** (this is the one profile-side admin connection point — don't skip it).
- [ ] Address CRUD: add, edit, delete, set-default — confirm the single-default invariant actually holds (setting a new default un-defaults the old one, there's never zero or two defaults).
- [ ] Orders/Addresses stat tiles on the Profile header show accurate live counts.
- [ ] Sign out works from here too (already covered in Q1, just confirm this entry point too).
- [ ] **Needs-decision:** `profile/settings.tsx` toggles (push/email/order-update notifications,
  dark mode, analytics) are confirmed non-functional (local state only). Decide with the user: wire
  them to something real before release, or ship with a known "settings are cosmetic in v1" note.
  Do not silently leave this ambiguous in the release — get an explicit answer.

**UI:**
- [ ] Avatar placeholder renders correctly when no real avatar URL exists.
- [ ] All the static legal/support pages (About, Contact, FAQ, Privacy, Terms, Returns, Shipping
  Policy, Women Who Grow) are reachable from the Settings/Profile menu, scroll correctly, and their
  back buttons return to the right place.
- [ ] Partner Dashboard / Apply menu label correctly reflects status (already covered in Q7 — just
  confirm the menu row itself, not the destination screen, picks the right label/icon).

---

### Q11 — Content (Healthy Living articles, Women Who Grow, legal/support)

**Screens:** `articles.tsx`, `article/[id].tsx`, `women-who-grow.tsx`, the static pages from Q10.
**DB:** none — all mock/static content, confirmed intentional (no CMS yet, T11 is optional/not required).

**Functional:**
- [ ] Article list → detail navigation works for every mock article, not just the first couple used in spot-checks so far.
- [ ] "View all" from Home's Healthy Living teaser reaches the full list.
- [ ] Women Who Grow's three entry points (profile/apply chip link, Settings menu, and anywhere else it's linked) all still resolve correctly after all other changes in this sweep.

**UI:**
- [ ] Article reader renders every `ArticleBlock` content type used anywhere in the mock data (not just the two articles already spot-checked), including images, if any article uses a block type the first two didn't.
- [ ] No orphaned links to content that doesn't exist (e.g., a "related article" pointing at a slug that was never created).

---

### Q12 — Cross-cutting UI/UX pass (all screens)

This is a second pass over **every** screen above, checking things that don't belong to one
feature area:

- [ ] Loading, empty, and error states exist and are intentional (not a bare blank view) on every
  data-fetching screen — make a checklist of screens and tick each one individually, don't eyeball it.
- [ ] Every icon-only touch target (bell, cart, back buttons, close/dismiss on banners) has an
  adequate hit area (`hitSlop` or large enough bounds) and, where feasible, an accessibility label.
- [ ] Keyboard handling: every text input screen (login, checkout address, profile edit, partner
  apply, subscription custom notes) avoids the keyboard correctly on both small and large phone
  screens, and the right keyboard type shows for email/phone/numeric fields.
- [ ] Safe-area insets respected on every screen with a custom header (not just relying on the ones
  already confirmed) — check a screen with a notch-style safe area emulated.
- [ ] Currency formatting (₹ symbol placement, decimal places) is consistent across Home, Explore,
  Cart, Checkout, Orders, Subscriptions, Partner dashboard — pick one format and confirm it's used
  everywhere, not a mix of `.toFixed(0)` and `.toFixed(2)` inconsistently.
- [ ] Haptic feedback is consistently applied to primary actions (or consistently absent) — not
  present on some buttons and missing on their near-identical siblings.
- [ ] Clean up confirmed-dead code from `src/mock/index.ts` (the exports flagged in the carry-in
  list) **only after** confirming via grep that nothing still imports them.
- [ ] Any remaining `console.log`/`console.warn` debug statements left in from development — sweep
  and remove (or gate behind `__DEV__`) before release.

---

### Q13 — Data integrity & security spot-check

Not a full security audit — a targeted sanity pass given this app is about to go live with real
user data and payments-adjacent flows.

- [ ] Spot-check RLS on a handful of sensitive tables by attempting (via the authenticated mobile
  client, not service role) to read another user's `orders`/`addresses`/`partners` row — confirm
  it's correctly denied, not just "happens to not be queried that way in the UI."
- [ ] Confirm the `partner-kyc` Storage bucket is still private (not publicly readable) and every
  access path goes through a signed URL or an RLS-gated `is_admin()` select.
- [ ] Confirm `.env` (holding `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`/`ANON_KEY`) is gitignored and no service-role
  key or other secret has ever been committed anywhere in `src/` (grep for `service_role` / long
  JWT-looking strings).
- [ ] Confirm the anon key's exposure is expected/safe (it is, by Supabase design, as long as RLS is
  correctly enforced everywhere — this check is really re-confirming Q13's RLS spot-checks above,
  not a separate concern).

---

### Q14 — Performance & stability

- [ ] Cold start time on the web preview is reasonable; note anything that visibly jank's on first
  paint (font flash, layout shift once real images load in).
- [ ] Repeated navigation between Home ↔ Explore ↔ Product detail ↔ back, several times in a row,
  doesn't show obviously growing memory/slowdown in the preview.
- [ ] react-query cache settings (`staleTime`, `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` globally) are sane for
  a shipped app — confirm nothing critical (like cart/stock-sensitive data) is stale for too long.
- [ ] Run `npx expo-doctor` (or the current equivalent) and resolve/triage anything it flags.
- [ ] **Human checkpoint:** a real device/simulator pass on iOS and Android for things this
  environment cannot verify — native picker behavior, push notification delivery end-to-end,
  haptics, cold-start performance on actual hardware, App Store/Play Store review-relevant
  permission prompts (camera/photos/notifications) actually showing the right system dialogs.

---

### Q15 — Deployment readiness checklist

- [ ] `app.json` reviewed: version string, `bundleIdentifier`/`package` final and correct, icons/
  splash/adaptive-icon assets all present at the right resolutions, `runtimeVersion`/`updates` URL
  point at the real EAS project (already looks configured — just confirm it's the production one,
  not a scratch project).
- [ ] Confirm which Supabase project (`EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`) the production build will point
  at — dev/staging vs. the real production project — and that production RLS/migrations are fully
  applied there (not just on a dev project this whole sweep has been run against).
- [ ] EAS build profile(s) in `eas.json` reviewed for a production build (check credentials,
  distribution type) — **do not actually trigger a production submit from here**; that's the user's
  call once this checklist is clear.
- [ ] Required store-listing content — privacy policy URL, app description, screenshots — noted as
  outside this file's scope (marketing/store-listing artifacts, not code) but flagged here so
  nothing falls through the cracks before submission.
- [ ] Final full re-run of `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, and every Bug Log row is `fixed`, `wontfix`
  (with the user's sign-off noted), or `needs-decision` explicitly answered — nothing left `open`.

## 📝 SESSION LOG

### 2026-10-07 — Q6 started (subscriptions)

**Fixed, live-verified (Expo web preview, port 8091):**
- `subscription/manage.tsx` pause/resume/cancel now check the Supabase `error` and show an `ErrorNotice`
  instead of silently reporting success on a failed write (closes the bug 14 carry-in from Q1).
- `subscription/plan.tsx` and `subscription/custom.tsx` were reachable signed-out via direct navigation
  with Start Subscription silently no-op'ing — added the same `Screen`+`EmptyState` login-prompt pattern
  used across Q1. Verified live: both show "Log in to subscribe" when navigated to directly while signed
  out, and the "Build Your Own" card on the Subscriptions tab correctly redirects to `/auth/login` instead
  of reaching the gated screen.
- Confirmed live: all 6 curated plans render on the Subscriptions tab with real `subscription_plans` data
  and prices; "Build Your Own" card present and wired correctly.

**Logged, not fixed (decisions or low priority):**
- Custom subscription's quantity stepper has no stock cap — same decision bucket as cart bug 21.
- The plans-tab fetch and the first-delivery-date fields have the same two low-priority gaps (no error
  state, no date validation) seen elsewhere in the app — logged once each rather than re-litigated per screen.

**Not re-verified:** the admin subscription-order-generation engine (curated + custom, idempotency) was
verified end-to-end in an earlier session per `GAP_REPORT.md`. Re-running it here would create and delete
real test data, so I didn't do it without a go-ahead.

**Next session:** Q7 (partner/B2B) continues the same approach.

### 2026-10-07 — Q5 started (orders)

**Found a real regression, fixed (code-reviewed, not live — no test account):**
- `(tabs)/orders.tsx` and `order/[id].tsx` were rewritten at some point on the `ui-refinement` branch and
  silently dropped the PRE-ORDER pill (order list) and the "Type: Pre-order" / "Expected availability" rows
  (order detail) that T4's "What was built" notes in `TASK_PLAN.md` describe. The underlying DB columns
  (`order_type`, `expected_availability_date`) were never removed, so this was a pure UI regression, not a
  schema change. Restored both, typecheck clean for `src/`.

**Verified in code, not live:**
- The BUG-05 business-order exclusion (`.neq('order_type', 'business')`) is intact.
- `notify_order_status_change()` (the order-status → push + inbox-notification trigger) is still the active
  definition — nothing removed it.
- `order/[id].tsx` has no `profile_id` filter on its query, relying on RLS alone. Checked the policy
  (`orders_select_own_or_admin`) — it's correctly scoped, so this is safe, not an IDOR bug.

**Logged, not fixed (decision needed):** bug 28 — the "Payment: Pending" badge has no action behind it
anymore since payment collection was removed; is it still useful copy or just noise now?

**Pattern worth naming:** Q1, Q4, and now Q5 have each hit the same wall — I can code-review and fix, but
can't *see* a real order move through pending → confirmed → delivered, or confirm a push/notification
actually lands, without a logged-in test account. That round-trip (OTP sign-in → place an order → change its
status in admin → watch mobile update) is now the single most valuable thing a session with a test account
could do, and it would close out Q1, Q4, and Q5's open live-verification items in one pass.

**Next session:** Q6 (subscriptions) continues the code-review approach; the test-account round-trip remains
the one blocking item for full sign-off on Q1/Q4/Q5.

### 2026-10-06 — Q4 started (cart, checkout, pre-order)

**Stock-decrement blocker — resolved.** The suspicion was that stock decrement lived only inside the removed
Razorpay function. It doesn't. Migration `20260930120000_order_stock_ledger.sql` and its follow-up
`20260930140000_stock_reserve_on_order.sql` add triggers on `orders` and `order_items` that reserve stock on
every non-cancelled order, and release it on cancel or delete, through a `stock_movements` ledger. Live
stock figures confirm it's working (several products are below 100).

**Code-reviewed (not live — no test account):**
- Pre-order insert: `order_type='preorder'`, `delivery_fee: 0`, `total = price × qty`, no payment step. ✔
- Standard checkout insert: `status='pending'`, coupon `discount_code` and `discount_amount` stored. ✔
- Rollback on item-insert failure (BUG-10): deletes the orphaned order row. The release trigger returns its stock. ✔
- Empty cart and signed-out guards: added in Q1 (bugs 5). ✔

**Found and logged, not fixed (need decisions):**
- Bug 23 — **the ₹499 free-delivery promise isn't implemented** (mobile ₹40, webapp ₹35.49). Home, FAQ, and
  the Shipping Policy page I wrote in T16 all promise it. The Shipping Policy text is copied from the
  webapp, so it's the same promise in both apps. This needs a pricing decision, not a code guess.
- Bug 24 — **client-trusted pricing.** Totals, discounts, and item prices come from the app. Fixing it means a
  DB change, so I'll wait for your go-ahead.

**Not verifiable from here:** placing a real order, the coupon apply/reject states, and the success screen
need a logged-in test account — the same blocker as Q1's OTP round-trip.

**Next session:** decide bugs 21, 23, and 24 with you, and agree a test account for the live order round-trip.

### 2026-10-06 — Q3 started (catalogue)

**Read-only checks against live data (anon-key REST query + web preview):**
- Explore counts 8 + 13 + 5 = 26, matching the 27 products in the DB minus the switched-off Choco Chill ✔.
- Category `juices` shows 5, matching Explore ✔. Search with no match shows the "No Results Found" state ✔.
- Product detail renders name, price, rating (stars + count — **T15 is already done**), nutrition,
  benefits, storage, and "You may also like" ✔.
- Stock is already dropping on live products (apple-sprout 97, fenugreek 99, green-apple-bag 98,
  green-detox-bag 98…). So inventory decrement **is** happening somewhere. This is evidence for the Q4
  blocker check, not a closed question. Q4 must still confirm the mechanism.

**Fixed (code), typecheck clean for `src/`:**
- `services/catalog.ts` + `types/index.ts`: `Product` now carries `isAvailable` and `stock`.
- `product/[id].tsx`: `unavailable` = not available, or out of stock and not pre-order. When unavailable the
  bottom button is disabled with a reason, and the pre-order note is hidden. Before this, Choco Chill showed
  an active Pre-order button. Verified live after a `--clear` restart.
- `preorder/[slug].tsx`: refuses unavailable products with a "Not taking pre-orders" state.
- `store/useCartStore.ts`: `addItemBySlug` selects `is_available, is_preorder, stock` and refuses unavailable
  products and out-of-stock non-pre-order products.

**Not verified — needs your go-ahead:**
- Admin-side writes (create a product, edit price, toggle availability, rename a category) and the mobile
  reflection of each. Those change the live catalogue, so I haven't done them without asking.
- The branch where a product is added to the cart from an `is_preorder=false` item is not reachable with the
  current data (everything is pre-order), so it's code-reviewed only.

**Next session:** decide bugs 19 and 20 with you, run the admin-write round-trip if you approve it, then Q4.

### 2026-10-06 — Q1 started (auth & onboarding)

**Tested live (Expo web preview, port 8091):**
- Signed-out gating of every auth-gated route: `orders`, `subscription/manage`, `profile/addresses`,
  `profile/edit`, `notifications`, `checkout`, `partner/dashboard`. Six of seven were wrong (bugs 1–6);
  `orders` was already correct (shows a sign-in prompt).
- Root route `/` after onboarding is complete and signed out → `/auth/login` ✔.
- Onboarding Skip → sets the persisted flag and reaches login ✔. Next/swipe did not advance on web (bug 13).
- Login: empty email → "Enter your email." ✔. Malformed email → now "Enter a valid email address." with no network call (bug 7).

**Fixed (code), typecheck clean for `src/`:**
- Added a `session`-keyed sign-in prompt (same `Screen` + `EmptyState` pattern `orders.tsx` already used)
  to `subscription/manage.tsx`, `profile/addresses.tsx`, `profile/edit.tsx`, `notifications.tsx`,
  `partner/dashboard.tsx`, `checkout/index.tsx`. All six re-verified live after a `--clear` restart.
- `checkout/index.tsx`: empty-cart state now shows an EmptyState instead of a ₹40 total. A `orderPlacedRef`
  keeps the post-order `clearCart()` from flashing the empty state before `router.replace` to success.
  Place Order with a not-yet-loaded profile now shows a message instead of silently returning.
- `auth/login.tsx`: `EMAIL_PATTERN` check before `sendCode`.

**Still open for Q1 (cannot be closed from here):**
- **OTP success path is NOT verified.** It needs a real inbox to receive the 8-digit code, and sending
  one to an arbitrary address would create an account on the live Supabase project — so I did not do it
  without your say-so. Needed: a test email you're happy to use, or you run this round-trip on a device.
  The DOB/name completion step, resend, and session-persist-after-relaunch are all covered by that.
- Needs-decision items 9, 10, 11 (copy, hero image, resend button) are yours to call.

**Next session:** finish Q1 with the OTP round-trip once a test email is agreed, then start Q3.

### 2026-10-06 — Plan created

Built this file at the user's request for a full pre-release QA sweep of the mobile app: every
screen, every admin↔mobile data connection, functional bugs and UI polish, fix-as-you-go, tracked
across sessions the same way `TASK_PLAN.md` tracks feature work. Status Board has 15 areas (Q1–Q15)
covering every screen in `src/app/` plus cross-cutting UI, security, performance, and deployment-
readiness passes. Flagged one likely **blocker** up front in the "Known carry-in items" section —
inventory stock decrement may be dead code since the Razorpay payment flow it was hooked to was
removed — to be confirmed first thing in Q4. Nothing executed yet; **next session starts at Q1**.
